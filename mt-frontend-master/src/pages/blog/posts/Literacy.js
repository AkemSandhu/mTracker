            <h2>Understanding Financial Illiteracy and How Online Trackers Can Help</h2>
            <p>Posted on <time dateTime="2024-10-22">October 22, 2024</time> by Akem</p>
            <p>Financial illiteracy is a significant issue that affects millions worldwide. Many individuals lack the
                basic knowledge to make informed financial decisions, leading to poor budgeting, excessive debt, and
                insufficient savings.</p>
            <p>Online financial trackers, such as mTracker, play a crucial role in addressing this issue. By providing
                users with tools to monitor their spending, set budgets, and analyze their financial habits, these
                applications empower individuals to take control of their finances.</p>
